          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>
            Aurora Studies is a student-run platform that translates academic research 
            into bite-sized, practical summaries. We focus on topics that actually matter 
            to students — sleep, focus, study techniques, well-being — and present the 
            science in clear, jargon-free language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every article is backed by real studies and includes citations, but we skip 
            the academic complexity and get straight to what you need to know.

          <h2>Why We Started</h2>
          <p>
            There’s a lot of advice out there for students, but not all of it is backed 
            by evidence. We wanted to create a space where students can find trustworthy, 
            research-based answers to common questions without wading through dense 
            academic papers or clickbait articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re trying to figure out if you should pull an all-nighter, 
            wondering if exercise really helps with focus, or just looking for better 
            study strategies, we’ve got you covered.

          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <ul class="approach-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Evidence-based:</strong> Every claim is backed by peer-reviewed research 
              and includes proper citations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Student-friendly:</strong> We write in clear, conversational language — 
              no unnecessary jargon or academic speak.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Practical:</strong> Our articles always include actionable tips you can 
              actually use in your daily routine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Honest:</strong> If the research is unclear or contradictory, we’ll tell you. 
              We don’t oversimplify just to make a point.

          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            Aurora Studies is run by students who care about evidence-based learning 
            and want to share what works. We’re not academics or professional researchers — 
            just students trying to make sense of the science that affects our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of us as your research translator: we read the studies so you don’t have to.
