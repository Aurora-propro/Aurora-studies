          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>
            Aurora Studies is a student-run platform that creates academic research articles
            into bite-sized, practical articles. We focus on topics that actually matter 
            to students such as topics that can be used in subjects. — and present the 
            work and conclusions in clear, jargon-free language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every article is backed by evidence and includes easy citation tools, but we skip 
            the academic complexity and get straight to what you need to know.

          <h2>Why We Started</h2>
          <p>
            There’s a lot of resources out there for students, but not all of it is backed 
            by evidence and is actually student led. We wanted to create a space where 
            students can find trustworthy, research-based answers to common questions 
            without swimming through dense academic papers or clickbait articles without clear statistics
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re trying to figure out if you should pull an all-nighter, 
            wondering if exercise really helps with focus, or just looking for better 
            study strategies or you need some citations for your graded piece of work,
                                         We got you covered.
